# Authentication System

This financial planner now includes a complete authentication system with separate files for better organization.

## Files Created

### 1. `auth.js`
Contains all authentication logic and utilities:
- `useAuth()` hook for authentication state management
- `login()` and `signup()` functions
- `validateEmail()`, `validatePassword()`, `validateName()` validation utilities
- `validateLoginForm()` and `validateSignupForm()` form validation helpers
- Mock user database (in production, this would connect to a real API)

### 2. `AuthComponents.jsx`
Contains the UI components for authentication:
- `LoginForm` component with email/password fields
- `SignupForm` component with name, email, password, and confirm password fields
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and user feedback
- Demo account credentials displayed

### 3. Updated `LH_life_financial_planner.tsx`
Main component now includes:
- Authentication state management
- Protected routes (users must be logged in to access the app)
- User data persistence (profiles and scenarios are saved per user)
- Logout functionality
- Seamless integration with existing financial planning features

## Features

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login/Signup**: Users can create accounts or sign in with existing credentials
2. **Session Management**: User sessions persist across browser refreshes using localStorage
3. **Data Persistence**: Each user's profile and scenarios are saved separately
4. **Logout**: Users can log out and return to the login screen

### Demo Account
For testing purposes, there's a demo account:
- **Email**: demo@example.com
- **Password**: demo123

### User Data Management
- User profiles are automatically saved when updated
- Financial scenarios are saved per user
- Data persists between sessions
- Each user has their own isolated data

### Security Features
- Form validation on both client and server side
- Password confirmation for signup
- Email format validation
- Secure password requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Error handling for invalid credentials

## Usage

1. **First Time Users**: Create an account using the signup form
2. **Returning Users**: Sign in with email and password
3. **Demo Users**: Use the provided demo credentials
4. **Profile Setup**: Complete your profile after authentication
5. **Financial Planning**: Create and manage scenarios as before
6. **Logout**: Use the logout button to end your session

## Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: Uses React hooks for authentication state
- **Data Storage**: localStorage for session persistence (mock implementation)
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with error messages
- **UI/UX**: Consistent design with the existing financial planner
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all auth operations

## Future Enhancements

In a production environment, you would want to:
1. Replace mock database with real API calls
2. Add password hashing and encryption
3. Implement JWT tokens for session management
4. Add email verification for signup
5. Add password reset functionality
6. Implement proper backend authentication
7. Add user roles and permissions
8. Add audit logging for security

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for a production authentication system while maintaining the existing functionality of the financial planner.
